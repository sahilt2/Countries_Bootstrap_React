## Countries APP

The main purpose of this project is to provide a learning platform for sharpening skills in React and Redux. The application relies on the REST Countries API for retrieving country information and the Open Weather API for real-time weather data.
Additionally, it leverages Firebase Authenticationto enable users to register and log in. User data and their favourite countries are stored in the Firebase Databse.
In summary, this repository provides a practical and comprehensive environment for enhancing your expertise in React, Redux, API integration, and database management while building a feature-rich countries app.
